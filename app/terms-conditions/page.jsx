            information or material made available by one Party to the other
            Party related to its business, operations, affairs, technologies,

            provided orally, in writing, or electronically, and marked as
            “confidential,” “secret,” or “proprietary.” The existence and terms
            of these Terms of Use are also considered Confidential Information.

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Is received from a third party lawfully in possession of it and
              under no confidentiality obligation to the disclosing Party.
            </li>
            <li>
              Is independently developed by the receiving Party without using
              the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">(ii) Disclosure of Confidential Information:</p>
          <p>Each Party agrees to:</p>
          <ul className="mt-3">
            <li>
              Use the same level of care to prevent disclosure of Confidential
              Information as it uses for its own similar information, but not
              less than reasonable care.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use Confidential Information solely to perform obligations under
              these Terms of Use.

          <p>
            The receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information as
            required by law or court order but must promptly notify the
            disclosing Party and cooperate to protect the confidentiality of the
            information. Confidentiality obligations survive termination of
            these Terms of Use.
